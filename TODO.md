# TODO: Replace "Send us a Message" Section in Contact Page

## Steps:

- [ ] Step 1: Remove form-related state (formData, isSubmitting), handlers (handleInputChange, handleSubmit), and unused imports (Input, Textarea, Label, useToast) from src/pages/Contact.tsx.
- [ ] Step 2: Remove the entire Contact Form Card section and adjust the grid layout to grid-cols-1 for full-width content.
- [ ] Step 3: Add a new "Project Overview" Card in place of the form, describing the AI blood group prediction project.
- [ ] Step 4: Verify the changes by running `npm run dev` and navigating to /contact to ensure the page renders correctly without errors.
- [ ] Step 5: Update this TODO.md to mark all steps as completed.
